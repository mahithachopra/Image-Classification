# 🧠 Image Classification with Deep Learning

This repository contains a complete end-to-end deep learning project for image classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in Python via Google Colab.

## 📌 Project Overview

This notebook walks through the process of building, training, and evaluating an image classification model. It covers:

- Dataset loading and preprocessing
- CNN model architecture
- Model compilation and training
- Evaluation on test data
- Accuracy and loss visualization

## 📂 Project Structure

.
├── Image_Classification.ipynb # Main notebook with complete implementation
├── requirements.txt # (Optional) List of required packages
└── README.md # Project documentation



## 🧪 Dataset

> *(Replace this section with your dataset name, e.g., CIFAR-10, MNIST, or a custom dataset)*

The model was trained on the `XYZ` dataset consisting of `N` classes. The data was split into training, validation, and test sets for robust evaluation.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook/ Google colab
- TensorFlow / Keras *(or PyTorch, update accordingly)*
- NumPy, Matplotlib, etc.
